1. Introduction1.1 English, Not LegaleseMost Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.Privacy is important, and we want you to understand the issues involved.

Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time and remain open to feedback.Where you read 'Element', Element Matrix Services, EMS, the Element app store, ESS or element.io it refers to all services made available athttps://element.iofor:The Element chat app, an open source Matrix client which you can use to connect to any server that implements the Matrix protocol;The purchase, provisioning, configuration, monitoring and management of hosted homeservers and associated services via the Element Server Suite (ESS), Element Matrix Services (EMS), or the Element app store.Where you read 'homeserver', 'homeservers' or 'the Homeserver', it refers to the services configured within Element which store the user account and personal conversation history, provide additional functionality such as bots and bridges, and (where enabled by the Customer) communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.Where you read the Service in this document, it refers to the Element chat app instances exposed onhttps://element.io(or subdomains) by New Vector Ltd (trading as Element), and hosted instances via EMS and/or ESS.Where you read 'Element' or 'we' or 'us' below, it refers to Element, a trading name of New Vector Ltd., its French subsidiary: Element Software SARL, its U.S. subsidiary: Element Software Inc, its German subsidiary: Element Software GmbH, and their agents.Element is the Data Controller for your data.

Apart from where otherwise noted, this document doesnotaddress data protection issues relating to the messaging and file data submitted by Users to the hosted homeserver instances, as this is the legal responsibility of the Customer. For general Terms of Use for Homeserver users, please see ourSoftware and Services Level Agreement (SSLA).This document does not cover:Your relationship with the Matrix server if it isn't provided by Element: Your account details and preferences, messages, files and any other data you share via the Matrix protocol are the responsibility of the Matrix server, and it is the provider of that server's job to make sure your data is handled appropriately and that you are well informed.Your relationship with identity servers: you might choose to use an identity server, to allow other Matrix users to discover you via the Element app. This is optional and requires your explicit consent to discover users from your personal contacts.

Put simply, you're a Customer if you're paying (or otherwise compensating) Element to provide a dedicated hosted messaging service. If you have an account registered on a homeserver that you use to send and receive messages, or use the Element chat app to connect any server within the Matrix Protocol, you are a User.It is possible to be both a Customer and a User, but we encourage you to consider these roles separately when thinking about Data Protection concerns.1.4 Changes to This DocumentOver time we may make changes to this document. If we make a material change we will provide the Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change. We will set forth the date upon which the changes will become effective; any use of Element by the Customer, or any use of Services by a User will constitute their acceptance of these changes.Your access and use of Element is always subject to the most current version of this document.2.

Our logs are kept for:30 days, for Customer IP addresses;180 days, for Element chat app IP addresses;180 days, for rageshakes.Usage InformationWe track usage data for Element hosting services. When you are signed in to your account we may track your usage of the site and associate that information with your account details. This data helps us understand how our users are using the application so that we can make improvements to the Service.Our analytics are powered by the Free and Open Source analytics platformMatomo, hosted entirely within our network. The servers which host this data are located in London, United Kingdom. We don't share any analytics data with third parties.If you are using the Element app, you will be asked to opt-in to this anonymised data collection. Your use of the Service does not rely on your opt-in to this. When using any of the Element chat clients after opt-in, your visit to the service will be logged, alongside your device ID and agent. This allows us to understand usage patterns based on each platform. The mapping of this data is logged for 28 days - from this point on only aggregated data is kept, for operational and statistical purposes.

This may include your IP address, hostname, full name and e-mail address. This information is collated in the application monitoring platformSentry.

You will be shown a disclaimer during your first time using this feature, but please apply caution and consideration when sharing your personal data within the app.The Element clients use the third-party serviceMapTilerto provide the images used to display maps.Element CallTo provide the Element Call service, including audio and video calls, Element processes network and usage information including IP addresses for the meeting participants as well as the specified URL used to host the meeting. Additionally, Element collects participant usernames (made up of a Matrix ID and device ID) as well as timestamps and data associated with the type of call (e.g. audio or video).Element Call is end-to-end encrypted, therefore no additional data about calls is processed.For ESS we use a self-hosted version of LiveKit by default within Element Call, although customers have the option to use LiveKit Cloud. For call.element.io we use LiveKit Cloud, for more details on LiveKits processing of data please refer to theirprivacy policy. LiveKit has no access to Element customer data.Push functionsPush tokens are generally used to authenticate a device against a push service. These allow for notifications received on Apple and Android devices to display information about a notification, such as who the sender is. The tokens generated by this function are not linked to a Matrix ID, but to a physical device insteadThis functionality means the operating system provider will be able to see metadata such as a roomID or eventID, but all other processing is done locally on your device. This means that no encrypted data is ever decrypted or shared externally, even using this function.2.4 Sharing Data in Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our RightsIn exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to:(a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,(b) protect the security or integrity of our products and services (e.g. for a security audit),(c) protect Element and our users from harm or illegal activities, or(d) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any person.Shared information is exclusively limited to what we are technically able to see, which means end-to-end encrypted information is never accessed by our teams or shared externally.2.5 How Do You Handle Passwords?We never store password data in plain text; instead they are stored hashed (with at least 12 rounds of bcrypt, including both a salt and a server-side pepper secret). Passwords sent to the server are encrypted using SSL.It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential. Actions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties.Users should manage good password hygiene (e.g. using a password manager) and change their password if they believe their account is compromised.If you forget your password (and you have registered an email address) you can use the password reset facility to reset it. If you have not associated an email address with your account and forget your password your account will be deemed lost. For your own privacy and security we do not reset passwords on any account.2.6 Our Commitment to Children's PrivacyWe never knowingly collect or maintain information in Element, through any of the Services provided, from those we know are under 18, and no part of Element is structured to attract anyone under 18.

Here'sAmazon's privacy policy. Amazon controls physical access to their locations.We use Cloudflare to mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks. Here'sCloudFlare's privacy policy.Physical access to our offices and locations use typical physical access restrictions.We use secure private keys when accessing servers via SSH, and protect our AWS console passwords locally with a password management tool.Nobody at Element, or any of our processors, is able to access encrypted data.2.11 What happens if Element is sold?In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets.2.12 How Is My Data Protected from Another User's Data?All of the Element user data resides within the same dedicated cluster. We use software best practices to guarantee that only the Customer can access it. In other words, we segment User data via software. We do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts User data on the same database, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack.2.13 What Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in the Service?If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at[email protected]. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern.

Introduction1.1 English, Not LegaleseMost Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.Privacy is important, and we want you to understand the issues involved. For that reason we decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our position as clear as possible. Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time and remain open to feedback.Where you read 'Element', Element Matrix Services, EMS, the Element app store, ESS or element.io it refers to all services made available athttps://element.iofor:The Element chat app, an open source Matrix client which you can use to connect to any server that implements the Matrix protocol;The purchase, provisioning, configuration, monitoring and management of hosted homeservers and associated services via the Element Server Suite (ESS), Element Matrix Services (EMS), or the Element app store.Where you read 'homeserver', 'homeservers' or 'the Homeserver', it refers to the services configured within Element which store the user account and personal conversation history, provide additional functionality such as bots and bridges, and (where enabled by the Customer) communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.Where you read the Service in this document, it refers to the Element chat app instances exposed onhttps://element.io(or subdomains) by New Vector Ltd (trading as Element), and hosted instances via EMS and/or ESS.Where you read 'Element' or 'we' or 'us' below, it refers to Element, a trading name of New Vector Ltd., its French subsidiary: Element Software SARL, its U.S. subsidiary: Element Software Inc, its German subsidiary: Element Software GmbH, and their agents.Element is the Data Controller for your data. We can be contacted as per the details below:Email:[email protected]Postal address:Elementc/o New Vector Ltd10 Queen Street PlaceLondonUnited KingdomEC4R 1AGShould you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an email to[email protected].1.2 Scope of This DocumentThis document explains how we process personal data, as it relates to:Element chat app users: Element chat app users use Element to connect to any server that implements the Matrix Protocol.Element Customers: Element Customers use EMS and ESS to provision and manage hosted homeservers. Apart from where otherwise noted, this document doesnotaddress data protection issues relating to the messaging and file data submitted by Users to the hosted homeserver instances, as this is the legal responsibility of the Customer. For general Terms of Use for Homeserver users, please see ourSoftware and Services Level Agreement (SSLA).This document does not cover:Your relationship with the Matrix server if it isn't provided by Element: Your account details and preferences, messages, files and any other data you share via the Matrix protocol are the responsibility of the Matrix server, and it is the provider of that server's job to make sure your data is handled appropriately and that you are well informed.Your relationship with identity servers: you might choose to use an identity server, to allow other Matrix users to discover you via the Element app. This is optional and requires your explicit consent to discover users from your personal contacts. For the identity server made available by us, please see theIdentity Server Privacy Policy.If you are using thematrix.orgserver provided by the Matrix Foundation, you can find the relevant Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditionshere.1.3 The Customer and the UserThis document is designed to explain Data Protections issues relating to Element Customers and Users. Put simply, you're a Customer if you're paying (or otherwise compensating) Element to provide a dedicated hosted messaging service. If you have an account registered on a homeserver that you use to send and receive messages, or use the Element chat app to connect any server within the Matrix Protocol, you are a User.It is possible to be both a Customer and a User, but we encourage you to consider these roles separately when thinking about Data Protection concerns.1.4 Changes to This DocumentOver time we may make changes to this document. If we make a material change we will provide the Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change. We will set forth the date upon which the changes will become effective; any use of Element by the Customer, or any use of Services by a User will constitute their acceptance of these changes.Your access and use of Element is always subject to the most current version of this document.2. Access to Your Data2.1 What is the legal basis for processing my data and how does this affect my rights under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)?2.1.1 Legal Basis for ProcessingElement has different legal basis for processing, based on which product you are using:Element Users: we collect your IP address when you request access to the Element client from our web server.

The Customer owns and controls all messages and files submitted to their homeserver by User accounts registered natively on their homeserver. This ownership does not extend to messages and files submitted over federation or bridging.This means that, in addition to the usual data access controls defined by the Matrix protocol, all unencrypted messages and files can be accessed by the Customer, and that access is retained even if no User account within the system retains access to the data.2.1.3 Your Rights as Data SubjectYou have rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you.

We host the Element Matrix Services on Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically: Our admin server is hosted in an AWS data centre in Amsterdam; Our deployment server is hosted in an AWS data centre in Stockholm; Customer deployments have the option to select the geographical location which is the most convenient for them; Amazon employees may have access to some of this data. Here'sAmazon's privacy policy. Amazon controls physical access to their locations. We use Cloudflare to mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks. Here'sCloudFlare's privacy policy.

In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets. 2.12 How Is My Data Protected from Another User's Data? All of the Element user data resides within the same dedicated cluster. We use software best practices to guarantee that only the Customer can access it. In other words, we segment User data via software. We do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts User data on the same database, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack. 2.13 What Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in the Service?
