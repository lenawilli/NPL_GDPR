Customer serviceHere Booking.com relies on the legal basis that the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract involving you, specifically to finalize and administer your trip reservation.If the required personal data isnt provided, Booking.com cant finalize the trip reservation with the trip provider, nor can we provide customer service to you about it.C. Promotion of safe and trustworthy service and prevention of fraudUnless provided otherwise in this overview, the collecting and processing of your personal data for these purposes is based on the legitimate interests of Booking.com or a third party. Before we process personal data to serve Booking.coms or a third-party's legitimate interests, Booking.com balances your rights and interests in the protection of personal data with Booking.coms rights and interests or those of the third party.The legitimate interests include, for example, avoiding financial harm from online fraud, sharing peoples experiences with prospective travelers, and keeping people informed about offers we think might be of interest.In the unlikely event Booking.com would process special categories of personal data in the context of purpose K, we rely, where applicable, on the fact that processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the individual or other legal bases as may be assessed at the time.L.
