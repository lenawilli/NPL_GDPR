We created Startpage to help you search and browse the internet privately. We created Startpage to help you search and browse the internet privately. When it comes to privacy, it's not just our policy. When it comes to privacy, it's not just our policy. We dont serve any of those. Startpage uses just one \"good\" cookie called \"preferences\" in order to remember the search preferences you choose. Its completely anonymous and expires after not visiting Startpage for 90 days.We don't record your search queriesWhen you search, your query is automatically stripped of unnecessary metadata including your IP address and other identifying information.We send the anonymized search query to our search and content providers and returnthe search results to you. We dont do that at Startpage. No profiling!Our search result pages may include a small number of clearly labeled \"sponsored links,\" which generate revenue and cover our operational costs. Those links are retrieved from platforms such as Google AdSense. In order to enable the prevention of click fraud, some non-identifying system information is shared, but because we never share personal information or information that could uniquely identify you, the ads we display are not connected to any individual user.Its a myth that search engines need to profile you in order to earn decent money. Startpage serves strictly non-personalized ads. Sure, our ads make only a fraction of what other search engine ads make, but they pay all our bills.What happens to your data beyond Startpage searchStartpage returns results from various sources. This is true for sponsored links, search results and other external links. Unless ... you use our proprietary feature\"Anonymous View\"  shown next to the search results. This is a great privacy tool that allows you to continue to browse in full privacy.For example, many video results are retrieved from YouTube API Services. Well only comply if were legally obliged to do so. Setting Startpage as the default search engine on all your organizations IT equipment will help you minimize the amount of personal data that is processed by or for your organization. Search queries are not collected, stored, or shared with third parties. Your browsing history is only available to you, on your own device. Your search and browsing history are not stored in our server logs. This report may include technical details about the device and what triggered the problem, but does not include personally identifying information (like your IP address).
