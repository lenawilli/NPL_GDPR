In general:Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, is designed from the ground up to ensure that no user data, especially personal data, is transferred to us.The optional Usage Survey app (usage report) can send us statistical data about the use of the instance, such as installed apps. This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users. Notifications are encrypted and signed by the server, checked and re-signed by the push proxy and then forwarded to the mobile device. This ensures minimal data transmission and protects user privacy throughout the process. Details of the transferred data can be foundhere. We do not store any personal data.With regard to third-party apps for the Nextcloud software: We cannot accept any responsibility for these apps and the user data stored or used by them. In our app store we have a policy against the misuse of private data. Any app found to be in breach of this policy will be removed from our app store and its author blocked. However, we do not have the capacity to check all the code of third-party apps and therefore advise caution when installing these apps.Please report problems and infringements related to our products toabuse@nextcloud.com.IV. Principles for the processing of personal data(1) Scope of the processing of personal dataWe collect and use our users personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of your personal data on our website only takes place with your consent. However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine).

Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed.

In general:Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, is designed from the ground up to ensure that no user data, especially personal data, is transferred to us.The optional Usage Survey app (usage report) can send us statistical data about the use of the instance, such as installed apps. This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users. Notifications are encrypted and signed by the server, checked and re-signed by the push proxy and then forwarded to the mobile device. This ensures minimal data transmission and protects user privacy throughout the process. Details of the transferred data can be foundhere. We do not store any personal data.With regard to third-party apps for the Nextcloud software: We cannot accept any responsibility for these apps and the user data stored or used by them. In our app store we have a policy against the misuse of private data. Any app found to be in breach of this policy will be removed from our app store and its author blocked. However, we do not have the capacity to check all the code of third-party apps and therefore advise caution when installing these apps.Please report problems and infringements related to our products toabuse@nextcloud.com.IV. Principles for the processing of personal data(1) Scope of the processing of personal dataWe collect and use our users personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of your personal data on our website only takes place with your consent. However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine).

This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users. Notifications are encrypted and signed by the server, checked and re-signed by the push proxy and then forwarded to the mobile device. This ensures minimal data transmission and protects user privacy throughout the process. Details of the transferred data can be foundhere. We do not store any personal data.With regard to third-party apps for the Nextcloud software: We cannot accept any responsibility for these apps and the user data stored or used by them. In our app store we have a policy against the misuse of private data. Any app found to be in breach of this policy will be removed from our app store and its author blocked. However, we do not have the capacity to check all the code of third-party apps and therefore advise caution when installing these apps.Please report problems and infringements related to our products toabuse@nextcloud.com.IV. Principles for the processing of personal data(1) Scope of the processing of personal dataWe collect and use our users personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of your personal data on our website only takes place with your consent. However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

RSS FeedsIn addition, unlike a newsletter, the use of the service does not require registration with an email address.To read the RSS feed, you need a so-called RSS reader. The RSS reader reads the feeds you have subscribed to and automatically notifies you of new entries. This allows you to keep an eye on new entries in the areas you have selected at all times. If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine). Alternatively, RSS feeds can also be displayed using special programs (feed readers), which can be more convenient.XVI Security ScannerOur security scanner works exclusively on the basis of publicly available information. This includes the list of known vulnerabilities, relevant to ownCloud and Nextcloud releases, as well as all existing hardenings and settings that can be checked without access to your server. Our scanner only checks if necessary and saves the results (server URL and the version of the last scan), but does not update them automatically. Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed. If you make changes, this will not be taken into account and you will have to perform the query again.XVII: Social media: Links to various offersWe maintain publicly accessible profiles in various social networks to which links are provided on the homepage:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Nextclouders/X:https://x.com/nextcloudersInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/nextclouders/Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextcloud-gmbhYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/nextcloudMastodon:https://mastodon.xyz/@nextcloudVimeo:https://vimeo.com/nextclouders(1) Description of the social media links(a) We have included links to our respective social media profiles on our website.

This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users.

However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

RSS FeedsIn addition, unlike a newsletter, the use of the service does not require registration with an email address.To read the RSS feed, you need a so-called RSS reader. The RSS reader reads the feeds you have subscribed to and automatically notifies you of new entries. This allows you to keep an eye on new entries in the areas you have selected at all times. If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine). Alternatively, RSS feeds can also be displayed using special programs (feed readers), which can be more convenient.XVI Security ScannerOur security scanner works exclusively on the basis of publicly available information. This includes the list of known vulnerabilities, relevant to ownCloud and Nextcloud releases, as well as all existing hardenings and settings that can be checked without access to your server. Our scanner only checks if necessary and saves the results (server URL and the version of the last scan), but does not update them automatically. Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed. If you make changes, this will not be taken into account and you will have to perform the query again.XVII: Social media: Links to various offersWe maintain publicly accessible profiles in various social networks to which links are provided on the homepage:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Nextclouders/X:https://x.com/nextcloudersInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/nextclouders/Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextcloud-gmbhYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/nextcloudMastodon:https://mastodon.xyz/@nextcloudVimeo:https://vimeo.com/nextclouders(1) Description of the social media links(a) We have included links to our respective social media profiles on our website.

Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

RSS FeedsIn addition, unlike a newsletter, the use of the service does not require registration with an email address.To read the RSS feed, you need a so-called RSS reader. The RSS reader reads the feeds you have subscribed to and automatically notifies you of new entries. This allows you to keep an eye on new entries in the areas you have selected at all times. If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine). Alternatively, RSS feeds can also be displayed using special programs (feed readers), which can be more convenient.XVI Security ScannerOur security scanner works exclusively on the basis of publicly available information. This includes the list of known vulnerabilities, relevant to ownCloud and Nextcloud releases, as well as all existing hardenings and settings that can be checked without access to your server. Our scanner only checks if necessary and saves the results (server URL and the version of the last scan), but does not update them automatically. Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed. If you make changes, this will not be taken into account and you will have to perform the query again.XVII: Social media: Links to various offersWe maintain publicly accessible profiles in various social networks to which links are provided on the homepage:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Nextclouders/X:https://x.com/nextcloudersInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/nextclouders/Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextcloud-gmbhYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/nextcloudMastodon:https://mastodon.xyz/@nextcloudVimeo:https://vimeo.com/nextclouders(1) Description of the social media links(a) We have included links to our respective social media profiles on our website.

The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

However, this data will not be deleted if we are authorised or obliged to continue storing it on the basis of a legal ground other than your consent or despite your objection (e.g. in connection with the processing of mandates).(6) Possibility of objection and removalAs a company, you can change your contact persons at any time after logging in.You can also contact us, e.g. by clickinghere, if you are not (or no longer) available as a contact person. However, since you were appointed by your company, we request that you seek clarification within the company.If you do contact us, please understand that we will need to confirm with the company how to proceed, especially if you are the only contact person.XIV Applications / Jobs(1) Description and scope of data processingIn the Jobs section, we publish our vacancies and ask you to send your applications by email. In your own interest, we recommend sending encrypted applications by email.When you apply for a position advertised by us, only our HR department and the relevant department will have access to your data. If you submit an unsolicited application, your details will be made available to all those specialist areas/departments with vacancies matching your applicant profile. Your data will only be shared with third parties if we are legally required to do so in individual cases. If we use processors, we ensure they are contractually obliged to protect your personal data in the same way.If you are employed by us, the data transmitted will be stored in your personnel file in compliance with the statutory provisions.(2) Legal basis for data processingThe legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an application by email is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, as the email contact is aimed at concluding a contract. An additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.(3) Purpose of data processingThe data you provide will be used solely for the purpose of making a decision about your employment and subsequently processing such an employment relationship.(4) Duration of storageThe data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. If no employment relationship is established between you and us, the application documents will be automatically deleted 7 days after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of ours stand in the way of deletion. Other legitimate interests in this sense include, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). All personal data stored in the course of the application will be deleted after a cancellation or objection [see (5) below] within a period of 7 days after receipt of the objection by our company.In any case, deletion will only take place insofar as no other legitimate interests on our part stand in the way of deletion. Other legitimate interests in this sense are, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).(5) Possibility of objection and removalYou can withdraw your application at any time and you can revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time [see XXI.(8) Right of revocation below]. If you send your application documents by email, you can object to the storage of your personal data at any time [see XXI.(1) Right to object below]. In such a case, however, the conversation and the decision about your employment cannot be continued.XV. RSS FeedsIn addition, unlike a newsletter, the use of the service does not require registration with an email address.To read the RSS feed, you need a so-called RSS reader. The RSS reader reads the feeds you have subscribed to and automatically notifies you of new entries. This allows you to keep an eye on new entries in the areas you have selected at all times. If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine). Alternatively, RSS feeds can also be displayed using special programs (feed readers), which can be more convenient.XVI Security ScannerOur security scanner works exclusively on the basis of publicly available information. This includes the list of known vulnerabilities, relevant to ownCloud and Nextcloud releases, as well as all existing hardenings and settings that can be checked without access to your server. Our scanner only checks if necessary and saves the results (server URL and the version of the last scan), but does not update them automatically. Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed. If you make changes, this will not be taken into account and you will have to perform the query again.XVII: Social media: Links to various offersWe maintain publicly accessible profiles in various social networks to which links are provided on the homepage:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Nextclouders/X:https://x.com/nextcloudersInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/nextclouders/Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextcloud-gmbhYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/nextcloudMastodon:https://mastodon.xyz/@nextcloudVimeo:https://vimeo.com/nextclouders(1) Description of the social media links(a) We have included links to our respective social media profiles on our website.

In general:Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, is designed from the ground up to ensure that no user data, especially personal data, is transferred to us.The optional Usage Survey app (usage report) can send us statistical data about the use of the instance, such as installed apps. This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users. Notifications are encrypted and signed by the server, checked and re-signed by the push proxy and then forwarded to the mobile device. This ensures minimal data transmission and protects user privacy throughout the process. Details of the transferred data can be foundhere. We do not store any personal data.With regard to third-party apps for the Nextcloud software: We cannot accept any responsibility for these apps and the user data stored or used by them. In our app store we have a policy against the misuse of private data. Any app found to be in breach of this policy will be removed from our app store and its author blocked. However, we do not have the capacity to check all the code of third-party apps and therefore advise caution when installing these apps.Please report problems and infringements related to our products toabuse@nextcloud.com.IV. Principles for the processing of personal data(1) Scope of the processing of personal dataWe collect and use our users personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of your personal data on our website only takes place with your consent. However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions.

All personal data stored in the course of the application will be deleted after a cancellation or objection [see (5) below] within a period of 7 days after receipt of the objection by our company.In any case, deletion will only take place insofar as no other legitimate interests on our part stand in the way of deletion. Other legitimate interests in this sense are, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).(5) Possibility of objection and removalYou can withdraw your application at any time and you can revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time [see XXI.(8) Right of revocation below]. If you send your application documents by email, you can object to the storage of your personal data at any time [see XXI.(1) Right to object below]. In such a case, however, the conversation and the decision about your employment cannot be continued.XV. RSS FeedsIn addition, unlike a newsletter, the use of the service does not require registration with an email address.To read the RSS feed, you need a so-called RSS reader. The RSS reader reads the feeds you have subscribed to and automatically notifies you of new entries. This allows you to keep an eye on new entries in the areas you have selected at all times. If you are interested in a new document, simply click on it and it will open in the browser. There are various technical options for obtaining RSS feeds, e.g. integration into an email client with corresponding functionality. The email client retrieves the latest news at predefined intervals and makes them available to you in a folder similar to new emails.You can find instructions for integration on the providers support pages (enter the name of the email client and the keyword RSS feed in a search engine). Alternatively, RSS feeds can also be displayed using special programs (feed readers), which can be more convenient.XVI Security ScannerOur security scanner works exclusively on the basis of publicly available information. This includes the list of known vulnerabilities, relevant to ownCloud and Nextcloud releases, as well as all existing hardenings and settings that can be checked without access to your server. Our scanner only checks if necessary and saves the results (server URL and the version of the last scan), but does not update them automatically. Under no circumstances is personal data collected or processed. If you make changes, this will not be taken into account and you will have to perform the query again.XVII: Social media: Links to various offersWe maintain publicly accessible profiles in various social networks to which links are provided on the homepage:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Nextclouders/X:https://x.com/nextcloudersInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/nextclouders/Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextcloud-gmbhYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/nextcloudMastodon:https://mastodon.xyz/@nextcloudVimeo:https://vimeo.com/nextclouders(1) Description of the social media links(a) We have included links to our respective social media profiles on our website.

In general:Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, is designed from the ground up to ensure that no user data, especially personal data, is transferred to us.The optional Usage Survey app (usage report) can send us statistical data about the use of the instance, such as installed apps. This data helps us improve our services. You have the option of checking and authorising this data before it is transmitted. We store the data in an aggregated form and not on a single server basis. As a result, this data cannot be used to draw conclusions about the information of an individual instance in the event of a data leak.When the updater app is activated, it sends information including the installed Nextcloud and PHP version, the installation time and the selected update channel to the Nextcloud updater server to obtain information about possible updates. We store a subset of information including the installation time and the installed version of the instance to collect statistical data.We operate a push proxy service for mobile applications for private users. Notifications are encrypted and signed by the server, checked and re-signed by the push proxy and then forwarded to the mobile device. This ensures minimal data transmission and protects user privacy throughout the process. Details of the transferred data can be foundhere. We do not store any personal data.With regard to third-party apps for the Nextcloud software: We cannot accept any responsibility for these apps and the user data stored or used by them. In our app store we have a policy against the misuse of private data. Any app found to be in breach of this policy will be removed from our app store and its author blocked. However, we do not have the capacity to check all the code of third-party apps and therefore advise caution when installing these apps.Please report problems and infringements related to our products toabuse@nextcloud.com.IV. Principles for the processing of personal data(1) Scope of the processing of personal dataWe collect and use our users personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The collection and use of your personal data on our website only takes place with your consent. However, an exception applies in cases where it is not possible to obtain prior consent for factual reasons and the processing of the data is nevertheless permitted by law.(2) Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe data transmitted or collected about you will be collected, used, processed, stored and, if necessary  if required by law or contract  passed on to third parties exclusively within the framework of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR, Federal Data Protection Act, State Data Protection Acts and Telemedia Act).Art. 6 GDPR provides various legal bases for the processing of your personal data, which are referenced in this privacy policy:6 para. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data if the data subject has given consent.6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This legal basis also applies to processing operations necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.If we have to process personal data to fulfil a legal obligation of our company, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 c) GDPR.6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh this first interest of our company or a third party, this processing is carried out on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.Furthermore, your consent may be the legal basis for data processing in the case of express consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and in the case of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofaras special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.The storage of information in the end users terminal equipment, such as via cookies stored on your computer, or access to information that is already stored in the terminal equipment, is only permitted if it is justified by one of the following legal bases: Section 25 (1) TDDDG: If the end user has consented on the basis of clear and comprehensive information. Consent must be given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR; Section 25 (2) no. 1 TDDDG: If the sole purpose is the transmission of a message via a public telecommunications network or Section 25 (2) no. 2 TDDDG: If the storage or access is absolutely necessary for the provider of a telemedia service to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user.(3) Data erasure and storage durationAs soon as the purpose of storing the respective personal data of the data subject no longer applies, it will be deleted or blocked. However, data may be stored beyond this point in time if this is provided for in European or national regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject as the data controller. The data will also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless further storage of such data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.(4) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countriesAs part of our business relationships, your personal data may be passed on or disclosed to third-party companies. These companies may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively to fulfil contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or lit. f in each case in conjunction with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR). We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points in this privacy policy.The European Commission certifies that some third countries have data protection standards comparable to the EEA standard by means of so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be found here:https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data pursuant to Art. 46 para. 1, 2 lit. c GDPR (the standard contractual clauses of 2021 are available athttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0915&locale-en), certificates or recognised codes of conduct as well as if you have given your express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).V.

We do not merge this data with other data sources, i.e. this data is not stored together with other personal data such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Nextcloud therefore does not use this information to identify its visitors.(b) Legal basisThe legal basis for this temporary storage of data and log files is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as our legitimate interests in this storage as set out below outweigh your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms: The IP address is considered personal data. Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to transmit our website to your browser. For this purpose, the IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session. It is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of our website. We also use the data to optimise our website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. The data is not analysed for marketing purposes.The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For data collected to provide our website, this occurs when the respective session ends. If the data was stored in log files, it is deleted after 7 days at the latest. However, it is also possible to store the data beyond this period. In such cases your IP address will be deleted or anonymised, making personal identification no longer possible.(d) Possibility of objection and removalThe collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website.
