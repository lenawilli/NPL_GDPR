Search queries are not collected, stored, or shared with third parties. While using the app, your privacy is now enhanced beyond what we have been able to offer on thewww.startpage.comwebsite, in that the third-party websites you visit within the app are not tracked, whether in a Regular or Private tab. Your browsing history is only available to you, on your own device. Your search and browsing history are not stored in our server logs. Additionally, within the app, we offer the option to utilize Anonymous View for browsing, allowing you to maintain anonymity to the third-party websites you visit, if desired.Diagnostic reportsIf the Startpage Private Browser app crashes or freezes, a report is sent to us to assist us in identifying and resolving the issue. This report may include technical details about the device and what triggered the problem, but does not include personally identifying information (like your IP address). We utilize a service called Sentry to store these reports.Product analyticsAnonymized analytics within the Startpage Private Browser app alert us when there are major product issues or outages, and help inform what enhancements may be needed to improve the experience. The analytics do not include personally identifying information (like IP address), or information about your searches or browsing activity. Example anonymized analytics are total number of installs, volumes of usage, errors, downtime, or whether new features are being used.Product event analyticsare powered by a service called Amplitude, and when this service is being used, data is proxied through servers managed by Startpage to ensure that personally identifying data is stripped before making its way to the service.

Startpage serves strictly non-personalized ads. Sure, our ads make only a fraction of what other search engine ads make, but they pay all our bills. Most online advertising today is personalized, meaning that online advertising services track what you do online and profile you in order to serve tailored ads. We dont do that at Startpage. No tracking. No profiling! Our search result pages may include a small number of clearly labeled "sponsored links," which generate revenue and cover our operational costs. Those links are retrieved from platforms such as Google AdSense. In order to enable the prevention of click fraud, some non-identifying system information is shared, but because we never share personal information or information that could uniquely identify you, the ads we display are not connected to any individual user. Its a myth that search engines need to profile you in order to earn decent money. Startpage serves strictly non-personalized ads. Sure, our ads make only a fraction of what other search engine ads make, but they pay all our bills. What happens to your data beyond Startpage searchStartpage returns results from various sources.
