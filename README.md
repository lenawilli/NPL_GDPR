# GDPR Compliance Scoring for Privacy Policies

## Problem Statement

Many companies publish privacy policiesâ€”but these are often **not GDPR compliant**.  
Manual verification of such policies is:

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Requires expert-level legal knowledge

This project addresses the need for **automated GDPR compliance checks**.

---

## Project Motivation

The goal is to develop an **NLP-based tool** that:
- Parses and analyzes privacy policy texts
- Compares them against the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** law
- Scores each policy based on its **coverage of GDPR articles**
- Identifies **compliance gaps** and missing clauses

This project contributes to regulatory technology and automated auditing solutions.

## Research Questions

- **Which GDPR clauses are most often missing or weakly covered** in company privacy policies?
- **What is the average compliance percentage** with GDPR law across Austrian companies?
